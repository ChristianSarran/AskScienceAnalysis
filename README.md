# CSCD25: Course Project


Reddit had an estimated 303.4 million (https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddits-2020-year-in-review/) new posts in 2020. It is a social media platform with growing popularity and with that comes better need for structure and organization of the platform. Some Subreddits including r/AskScience use a manual flair method where a mod will assign a topic to a post inorder to make organizing, filter and search of the subreddits easier. The goal of the project will be to determine if the current flair system implemented in the subreddit r/AskScience is succeeding, can it be improved and if auto flair detection and assignment could be possible. Beyond this we will try to better understand reddit and r/AskScience as a community to ensure best the outcomes. We will look at post data from 2016-2020

Is there a domaince of specific types of science as a result of the platform?(i.e. higher voted topics will trend to people asking about those topics
Bigger reddit communities? Bigger population?


First lets try to understand the subreddit as whole.

There are 62 unique flairs total, of which 42 have been used less than 5 times. Many are AMA based some of which a mix of multiple science fields. A few are listed below to gain  a sense of what these look like:
