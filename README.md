# CSCD25: Course Project


Reddit had an estimated 303.4 million (https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddits-2020-year-in-review/) new posts in 2020. It is a social media platform with growing popularity and with that comes better need for structure and organization of the platform. Some Subreddits including r/AskScience use a manual flair method where a mod will assign a topic to a post inorder to make organizing, filter and search of the subreddits easier. The goal of the project will be to determine if the current flair system implemented in the subreddit r/AskScience is succeeding, can it be improved and if auto flair detection and assignment could be possible. Beyond this we will try to better understand reddit and r/AskScience as a community to ensure best the outcomes. We will look at post data from 2016-2020
